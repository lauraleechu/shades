#Colorism and Cosmetics: Investigating Limited Shade Ranges in the Beauty Industry in Japan and India
This research paper explores the issue of colorism in the context of the beauty industry in Japan and India. Drawing on data from an article published by The Pudding, the paper focuses on the association between the lightness and saturation of foundation shades provided by leading makeup brands in India and Japan. The findings reveal a preference for lighter shades in international brands, whereas domestic brands offer a broader spectrum of shades with warmer undertones. The study uncovers a negative correlation between the saturation and lightness of foundation shades, with Japanese foundation shades being paler and having an ashier tone, and Indian foundation shades being substantially lighter than the natural skin tone. The scarcity of foundation shades for individuals with darker skin tones can lead to their marginalization and exclusion, perpetuating the issue of colorism in the beauty industry.
